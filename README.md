**Mod Concept:** Ever wanted to walk on an alien world orbiting the nearest star to our Sun? **Proxima Centauri b: Exoplanet Explorer** brings a scientifically-inspired, *hypothetical non-tidally locked* version of this fascinating exoplanet into Minecraft! This mod focuses on creating an immersive experience where players can explore a world shaped by a red dwarf star and learn about its unique environmental characteristics directly through gameplay.

**Core Features:**

*   **New Dimension:** Travel 4.2 light-years to the Proxima Centauri system and explore the surface of Proxima b.
*   **Unique Alien Environment:**
    *   **Orange-Red Sky:** Experience daytime under the distinct light of the cool red dwarf star, Proxima Centauri, accurately affecting atmospheric scattering.
    *   **Red-Tinged Landscape:** Terrain blocks reflect the ambient reddish light, giving the world an otherworldly feel.
    *   **Dark Flora:** Discover custom plant life adapted to the low-light, infrared-rich environment, appearing black or deep red to maximize light absorption.
*   **In-Game Planetary Science Facts:** As you explore the Proxima b biome, receive periodic "Field Tips" directly in your chat! These timed messages explain *why* the environment looks the way it does, covering topics like:
    *   The reason for the orange-red sky color (stellar temperature).
    *   Why plants might be black/dark red (photosynthesis adaptation).
    *   Facts about the planet's potential characteristics (age, tidal locking likelihood, lack of moon - based on the profile).
    *   Hints about potential animal adaptations (e.g., infrared vision).
*   **Immersive Atmosphere:** Custom sky textures and potentially altered water colors enhance the feeling of being on an alien world.

**The Science Behind the Scenery:**

This mod takes inspiration from scientific papers and climate simulations of Proxima Centauri b. While the real planet is likely tidally locked, we explore a hypothetical rotating version. Key educational elements delivered via the in-game chat system include:

*   **Stellar Influence:** Understanding how a red dwarf's light spectrum dictates sky color and potential plant adaptations.
*   **Exoplanet Characteristics:** Introducing concepts like orbital distance, stellar wind, tidal locking, and habitability factors in an engaging way.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Platform:** Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.4
*   **Modding Tool:** MCreator 2025.1
*   **Mod Loader:** NeoForge
*   **Key Implementation:** Custom dimension, biome, blocks, sky rendering, and a procedure-driven system using `Player Tick Update` and `Player Persistent Variables` to manage the timed delivery of educational chat messages.

**Future Ideas:**

*   Adding spectacular auroral displays driven by intense stellar wind.
*   Implementing unique passive/hostile mobs with adaptations like infrared senses.
*   Craftable datapad item for collecting and reviewing discovered planetary facts.
*   More diverse terrain generation and unique geological features.
